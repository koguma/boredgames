# boredgames - WIP

Back-end written in Python + FastAPI, Front-end in Svelte

Demo will be available soonTM

Play a wide variety of games, be it : connect4, chess, checkers, etc... with your friends, bots, or anyone online!

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
